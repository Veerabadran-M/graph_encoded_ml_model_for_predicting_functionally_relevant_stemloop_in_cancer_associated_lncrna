confirmed that hotair-induced prc2 target genes,such as jam2,pcdh10,pcdhb5,were transcriptionally repressed upon hotair expression and de-repressed upon concomitant prc2 depletion (fig.4d).Hotair-induced genes were also reversed upon prc2 depletion (fig.4d).Of note,many of the genes induced by hotair are known positive regulators of cancer metastasis,including abl2,snail,and laminins.Long non-coding rna hotair reprograms chromatin state to promote cancer metastasis.A number of the genes with hotair-induced prc2 occupancy are implicated in inhibiting breast cancer progression,including transcription factors hoxd10 and prg1,encoding progesterone receptor (a classic favorable prognostic factor)/ cell adhesion molecules of the protocadherin (pcdh) gene family and jam2/ and epha1,encoding an ephrin receptor involved in tumor angiogenesis.The lincrna termed hotair is increased in expression in primary breast tumors and metastases,and hotair expression level in primary tumors is a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death.Enforced expression of hotair in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts,leading to altered histone h3 lysine 27 methylation,gene expression,and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on prc2.We transduced vector- or hotair-expressing mda-mb-231 cells with short hairpin rnas (shrnas) targeting prc2 subunits ezh2 or suz12.Immunoblot analyses confirmed efficient depletion of the targeted proteins (fig.4a).Depletion of either suz12 or ezh2 had little impact on the invasiveness of control cells,but completely reversed the ability of hotair to promote matrix invasion (fig.4b).These results suggest that prc2 is specifically required for hotair to promote cellular invasiveness.Therapeutic targeting using tumor specific peptides inhibits long non-coding rna hotair activity in ovarian and breast cancer.In the current study,wedescribe a peptide nucleic acids (pna)-based approach to block the ability of hotair to interact with ezh2 and subsequently inhibit hotair-ezh2 activity and resensitize resistant ovarian tumors to platinum.Treatment of hotair-overexpressing ovarian and breast cancer cell lines with pnas decreased invasion and increased chemotherapy sensitivity.Furthermore,the mechanism of action correlated with reduced nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kb) activation and decreased expression of nf-kb target genes matrix metalloprotease 9 and interleukin 6.Quantitative pcr showed that hotair is overexpressed from hundreds to nearly two thousand- fold in breast cancer metastases,and hotair level is sometimes high but heterogeneous among primary tumors.We next measured hotair level in an independent panel of 132 primary breast tumors (stage i and ii) with extensive clinical follow-up13.Indeed,nearly one third of primary breast tumors overexpress hotair by over 125-fold over normal breast epithelia,the minimum level of hotair overexpression observed in bona fide metastases,and high hotair level is a significant predictor of subsequent metastasis and death.The lincrna termed hotair is increased in expression in primary breast tumours and metastases,and hotair expression level in primary tumours is a powerful predictor of
