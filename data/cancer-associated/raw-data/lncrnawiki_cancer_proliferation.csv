rna pvt1 functions as a competing endogenous rna by sponging mir-186 in gastric cancer.Further functional experiments indicated up-regulation of pvt1 promoted the gc cell proliferation and invasion,while down-regulation of pvt1 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion.In addition,pvt1 could directly interact with mir-186 in gc cells and this interaction lead to the inhibition of downstream of hif-1alpha expression.Overexpression of long non-coding rna pvt1 in gastric cancer cells promotes the development of multidrug resistance.Pvt-1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues of cisplatin-resistant patients and cisplatin-resistant cells.While,pvt1 overexpression exhibit the anti-apoptotic property in bgc823 and sgc7901 cells transfected with lv-pvt1-gfp and treated with cisplatin.Moreover,qrt-pcr and western blotting revealed that pvt1 up-regulation increased the expression of mdr1,mrp,mtor and hif-1alpha.Overexpression of lncRNA pvt1 in gastric carcinoma promotes the development of mdr,suggesting an efficacious target for reversing mdr in gastric cancer therapy.Pvt1 expression was markedly upregulated in gc tissues and cell lines,and high expression levels of pvt1 were obviously correlated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis.Further functional experiments indicated up-regulation of pvt1 promoted the gc cell proliferation and
